ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a web-based Project & Procurement Management System to replace manual Excel workflows.
The system should allow your father to:

Manage multiple projects

Track procurement, cutting, dispatch, and production

Maintain historical records (no overwriting data like Excel â€” every change is tracked with dates)

Assign responsibilities via workflows

Generate dashboards and filtered reports
